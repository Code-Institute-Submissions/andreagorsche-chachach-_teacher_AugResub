# Welcome to the ChaChaCha Teacher Website,

You want to learn how to dance the ChaChaCha? Then my webiste is the place to go. In an interactive game the users can learn the basic dancing steps with or without music, stopping and getting back at it as they choose, shuffle through the provided music and track their practice time.

In an initial step the users are asked whether they want to learn the leading steps of the dance or the non-leading steps. Then they are directed to the according sub-page where the dancing fun starts. 

The site is targeted at users who have no or only minimum knowledge of the dance and need to learn the basics fast and uncomplicated. They might have a wedding, school dance or party coming up where they have to dance or should be able to. If time is too short to book a live dancing class or maybe the users want to save the cash, ChaChaCha Teacher is the place they go to.

# Responsiveness
All three pages are responsive as shown below.

# Features Overall

## Navigation Bar
On top of each page there is a navigation bar allowing the user to get back to the main page or switch between the two different virtual dancefloors (leading steps and non-leading steps).

# Features Main Page

## Intro Box
The introbox consists of a heading that is quickly caught by the eye of the user so they know the name of the game. Furthermore, they are informed what the game is about and given an initial choice depending on whether they want to learn the leading or non-leading steps.

# Features Subpages

## Subpages Title and Background
The title of the subpage consists of the name of the game (ChaChaChaTeacher) and the chosen steps (leading or non-leading). This is important for the user to know where in the game they are and what they are about to learn. Furthermore the different backgrounds further underline if they are on the page of leading steps (usually men) or non-leading steps (usually women).

![Background Men](assets/images/readme/backgroundstitles/backgroundmen.png)

![Background Women](assets/images/readme/backgroundstitles/backgroundwomen.png)

## Dancefloor
The dancefloor is split into 3 parts. 

![Complete Dancefloor](assets/images/readme/interface/complete_dancefloor.png)

### Music Panel

First, there is the music panel where the user can mute and shuffle music. When the users click the mute button to stop the music, the button turns red. If they click again to continue with music, the button will turn into its original grey color.

### Steps Area

Secondly, there is the steps area with a default steps picture at the beginning. This pic is supposed to give the users a glimpse of what to expect of the animation and also to teach them how to initially put their feet.

### Start Panel

Thirdly, the start panel.

![Start Panel](assets/images/readme/interface/startpanel.png)

Here, the user can start and pause the teaching session. When pressing the start button a 3 seconds countdown will show and give the user time to get ready to dance. 

![Counter And Practice Time](assets/images/readme/features/counterandpracticetime.png)

The practice time starts and music already sets in so the users have time to register the music and its speed. 

The speed of the music was chosen slowly on purpose to fit beginners purposes. As a last step the 8 steps sequence starts playing. It will repeat until the users press the pause button or leaves the page.

![Steps Animation](assets/images/readme/features/steps1.png)

When the users click the pause button the music and animation stops and the word 'Stopped' is showing in the middle of the steps section. Thus, the users know that they indeed stopped the game.

# Features left to implement

There are a few features that could be implemented in the future:

-  more types of dances (renaming the game to 'Dance Teacher')

-  a two-player mode where the users can practice side by side

- add different difficulty levels 

- add the possibility to play with usernames, tracking and ranking the best players by practice time and/or levels completed

# Testing

Throughout the coding process I did test and debug the code over and over, trying different features and ways to get them going best. This is also visible in the commit protocol.

## Central Debugging Cases

### Timeout 
When starting the project I had a clear vision of looping through an array of pictures in my head. Little did I know how complex this would get.
A main learning was that without a Timeout the pictures are shown too fast and the users will not be able to comprehend. Thanks to my mentor on helping me solve that problem.

### Indexing Multiple Times
Initially starting with a for loop, I soon realized that another approach might be more efficient. Looping through the array multiple times was not possible in the first version I had. Instead it stopped after 8 steps and the music continued playing. A pity. So I changed the function changeStepImage, added an index with modulator. By calling the function at the end again, refering to that index and adding a +1 to it, the magic was done.

### Making the Steps Stop
While stopping the music was quite straight forward, considering there are pre-defined functions to pause and play music, I had quite a hard time figuring out how to stop the iterating array once started. I tried first to connect it to whether the music was playing or not. So, only play the steps if the music is playing (not muted, not ended, not paused). But I couldn't make that work and I figured a more straightforward approach was needed.

I read in more detail about the setTimeout function and its clearTimeout function. I realized that I needed to clear the Timeout to make the steps stop. At the same time I wanted the user to know that they stopped the steps that's why I integrated the message with an innerHTML.

### Making the Counter Work
The counter didn't work until my mentor pointed out that I needed the setInterval function to make it work.

Another challenge with the counter the positioning above the steps div. First I tried to solve it with the z-index but eventuelly with the position property it was much easier.

### Setting up the Practice Time
The idea for the practice time came from one of the classes examples. I actually thought it would be copy/paste but I wanted the feature to work onclick not as soon as the page loaded. So I needed to adapt the code. My mentor helped me hear by pointing out the parseInt function to me which converts string to integers.

### Coloring the Mute Button
The idea behind coloring the button in click was to give the button a value (red or grey) and depending on that value the program knows what to do (e.g. play music, stop music). And I was right, from the time the color work, the music stopped due to the according function.

### Shuffle Music
The shuffle button was the only code that really turned out exactly as I thought of it before. I knew I would need Math.floor and Math.random and that is exactly how it turned out. When addressing the array I made a mistake my mentor found and explained to me: Never address the array, address the variable representing each single element of the array.

## Validators

### HTML
The main page and the subpages were tested with the WRC validator for HTML and no errors occured.

# Main Learnings
## Number of Functions
I had like 6 functions on my first draft only to have many, many more in the end. I realized that some concepts I had in my mind for one function was too complex or just required sub-functions. Like e.g. having 2 functions for the random shuffle - 1 function to generate the random number and one to execute the shuffle.

## Properties vs Functions
In one if else I tried to write a condition connected to a function. A big no, no. Never use functions for conditions, use properties.

## Array vs Element
When doing the shuffle function and the iteration through the picture array I addressed the array itself. My mentor told me that I always need to address the variable representing the single elements of an array.

# Understanding the Difference Between onclick and addEventListener
I played around a lot with calling functions on click. Thereby I tested the two possible ways 'on click' and 'addEventListener'. I realized that 'onclick' overwrites if used multiple times and addEventListener can actually be used on one button multiple times.

# Understanding the Difference Between setTimeout and setInterval
When trying to solve my problem of stopping the steps on pause click, I read a lot about setTimeout and setIntervals, watched videos and got behind their systematic. They will definitely be very helpful in the future. I have new project ideas already.

# Calling multiple Functions a once
Pretty early on in the project I realized that pressing the start button will have to do multiple things:
- run a counter
- start the music
- load the pic array 
- start the practice time

Although I think it was mentioned in the class that one function can call on other functions, I realized how crucial this is when starting to code my start button features. I also realized in that context how important a clear structure and naming of functions is.

# Deployment
The project ChaChaCha teacher was deplayed using GitHub pages. Therefore, I went to the GitHub  website and:
- picked the repository 
- clicked on settings
- choose the tab 'pages'
- in the source section I clicked on the drop-down     menu, choose main and clicked save

The website refreshed revealing the link to the published page which you can find here:

# Credits

## Mentor Help
The concept and writing of the code was done by me. My mentor helped me significantly in understanding the Javascript logic, especially in the following parts (also mentioned in the deployment section):
- addressing music in array (via variable)
- showing me how to use setInterval and setTimeout to make the practice time, the counter and my steps array work out
- introducting me to parseInt without which the practice time display wouldn't have happend
- connecting my clicked function to the mute button and making the muting work properly without an if else statement
- helping me with logic mistakes in the code

## Code from Class
The code for the practice time was very much inspired by a code sample from the course. Like explained in the debugging section the code needed adaption, still referencing it here.

Special thanks to my mentor who always makes the most out of our sessions.
